# 100 Days of Data Structure Algorithm  

Welcome to the **100 Days of Data Structure Algorithm** repository. This project is designed to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms over 100 days of consistent practice.  

## Description  

Every day I will update this repository with new exercises and solutions. All exercises are sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), a popular platform for practicing programming problems and enhancing your skills in algorithms and data structures.  

### Repository Structure  

- Each day will have its own folder with the exercises completed.  
- Inside each folder, you will find solutions and explanations for each problem.
